This is my process for design laser cut pins.
In this example I am designing a D20 Pin, so I started off by taking several photos of a D20 (In this case a MTG spin down).![IMG_1090-64d48a.png](/uploads/IMG_1090-64d48a.png)
I apologize for the low image quality, for the purposes of what I am doing it doesn't matter. I Loaded up the image in Inkscape, and started tracing the panels.![D20 Pin S#3.png](/uploads/D20%20Pin%20S%233.png)
